  Fork of <a href="https://github.com/agegr/pi-web">pi-web</a> by <a href="https://github.com/agegr">@agegr</a> 
</p>


The web view for [omp (oh-my-pi)](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi). omp-web reads the sessions the `omp` CLI already writes and gives you a browser workspace for session browsing, real-time chat, model roles, provider configuration, skill management, and project file preview.

It is not a separate agent: omp-web runs omp's own SDK in-process, against the same `~/.omp/agent` directory, so a session started in the terminal continues in the browser and back again.


## Install this fork

This fork is not published to npm (the `omp-web` name belongs to upstream). Every release attaches an installable package, and a Docker image is published to GHCR:

```bash
bun add -g https://github.com/jr551/omp-web/releases/latest/download/omp-web.tgz
omp-web            # http://127.0.0.1:30141
```

A specific version: `https://github.com/jr551/omp-web/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/omp-web-X.Y.Z.tgz`.

```bash
docker run -d --name omp-web \
  -p 127.0.0.1:30141:30141 \
  -v "$HOME/.omp:/home/omp/.omp" \
  -v "$HOME/projects:/workspace" \
  ghcr.io/jr551/omp-web:latest
```

The image runs as UID 1000; build it yourself with `--build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g)` if your user differs. The upstream instructions below (`bunx omp-web`, `npm install -g omp-web`) install the upstream release, not this fork.

### What this fork adds over upstream

- Runs on the latest omp SDK (18.3.x) — upstream's automated bumps stalled at 18.1.17.
- Much faster tab switching: open file tabs stay mounted (React `<Activity>`), and the chat no longer re-parses every answer on each switch.
- `/guided-goal` works in the browser; advisor activity badge; OAuth sign-in from a remote browser (full URL + OpenAI device login); create folders from the directory picker.
- Sidebars reveal on screen-edge hover; dropdowns and dialogs stay inside the viewport.
- Local providers keep working behind `HTTP_PROXY` on Bun 1.4; the Windows desktop build no longer fails.

## Quick Start

omp-web serves its API on **Bun**, because that is what the omp SDK requires (it is published as TypeScript sources and imports `bun:` builtins). Install Bun 1.3.14 or newer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash        # macOS / Linux
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"    # Windows
```

**Run without installing:**

```bash
bunx omp-web@latest
```

On Windows, if `bunx` fails before startup with `EPERM: Operation not permitted (NtSetInformationFile())` while moving a package to the Bun cache, the failure is in Bun's Windows cache rename, not in omp-web. Update Bun and retry with a fresh cache:

```powershell
bun upgrade
bun pm cache rm
$env:BUN_INSTALL_CACHE_DIR = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\omp-web-bun-cache"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $env:BUN_INSTALL_CACHE_DIR | Out-Null
bunx omp-web@latest
```

If an antivirus or endpoint-security process still holds the extracted directory open, use npm for dependency installation; the `omp-web` launcher still starts the server through Bun:

```powershell
npm install -g omp-web@latest
omp-web
```

**Or install globally:**

```bash
bun add -g omp-web    # or: npm install -g omp-web
omp-web
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:30141](http://127.0.0.1:30141). The CLI opens the browser automatically once the server is ready, and listens on `127.0.0.1` by default.

The `omp-web` entrypoint itself runs under Node or Bun; it locates Bun and re-executes the server there. Point it at a specific build with `OMP_WEB_BUN=/path/to/bun`.

**Options:**

```bash
omp-web --port 8080              # custom port
omp-web --hostname 0.0.0.0       # expose on a trusted network
omp-web -p 8080 -H 0.0.0.0       # combine options
omp-web --no-open                # do not open the browser automatically
omp-web --authenticated          # require a password (asks for one if none is set)
omp-web --reset-password         # set a new password when the old one is lost

PORT=8080 omp-web                 # environment variable is also supported
OMP_WEB_HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 omp-web  # explicit network exposure
OMP_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS=omp.internal omp-web  # allow an exact proxy/custom hostname
OMP_WEB_AUTHENTICATED=1 omp-web   # same as --authenticated
OMP_WEB_PASSWORD='a-long-random-password' omp-web  # override the stored password
OMP_WEB_NO_OPEN=1 omp-web         # useful when running as a background service
```

## Docker

A `Dockerfile` builds omp-web from source and runs it under Bun in the
container. It still needs the omp home the CLI writes, so mount it:

```bash
OMP_WEB_PASSWORD='a-long-random-password' \
OMP_UID=$(id -u) OMP_GID=$(id -g) docker compose up --build
```

That publishes <http://127.0.0.1:30141> with the password lock on, sharing
`$HOME/.omp` with the container so terminal sessions continue in the browser.
Volume layout, UID/GID matching and reverse-proxy notes: [docs/docker.md](./docs/docker.md).

## Password access

A password locks the web interface and every API endpoint behind HTTP Basic Auth, with the fixed username `omp`. Turn it on wherever suits you:

- **Settings → Access** in the browser, to set the password and switch the lock on or off.
- **`omp-web --authenticated`**, which turns it on for this run and every later one, and asks for a password on the terminal if none has been set yet.
- **`OMP_WEB_PASSWORD`**, which overrides the stored credential for as long as it is set.

The password is stored as a `scrypt` hash in `~/.omp/agent/omp-web-auth.json` (mode `0600`) — never in plaintext, and never recoverable from the file. Forgotten it? Run `omp-web --reset-password` on the server, or open `/recover` and enter the one-time code omp-web prints on its own console.

omp-web can invoke a high-privilege agent. Basic Auth does not encrypt the password in transit, so do not expose plain HTTP to the internet. Use HTTPS through a trusted reverse proxy or a trusted VPN for remote access.
API requests accept loopback names, IP literals, the selected bind hostname, and exact comma-separated names in `OMP_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. Configure that variable when a trusted reverse proxy uses a different external hostname.

Full details, including the recovery threat model: [docs/authentication.md](./docs/authentication.md).

## Model roles

omp does not have "the" model — it has a model per **scope of work**, and omp-web exposes the same roles the TUI's `/model` selector and `Ctrl+P` cycle use:

| Role | What it runs |
| --- | --- |
| `default` | ordinary turns |
| `smol` | cheap, fast subagent and background work |
| `slow` | deep reasoning on hard problems |
| `plan` | plan mode |
| `commit` | commit messages and changelogs |
| `task` | the model subagents spawn with |
| `advisor` | the second model that reviews every turn |
| `vision`, `designer`, `tiny` | image turns, design work, classification |

Two places surface them:

- **The model picker in the chat bar** lists the configured roles above the flat model list. Picking one switches the session onto that role's model *and records the role*, exactly like `/model` does, so the transcript and omp's retry fallbacks agree on which role is driving.
- **Models → Model roles** assigns a model to each role. Writes go to `modelRoles` in `~/.omp/agent/config.yml` (or `.omp/config.yml` when you pick **This project**), which is the same record the CLI reads — an assignment made in the browser is what your next terminal session starts with.

Session titles follow the same routing: omp-web asks omp to name a session, and omp resolves that through the `tiny` → `commit` → `smol` chain rather than the session's primary model.

The reasoning selector supports **Auto**, which lets omp select effort for each turn. The selector keeps Auto selected across reloads and shows the resolved effort separately, for example `auto (high)`. Selecting Auto explicitly also carries that preference into a new session.

## HTTP Proxy

omp-web reads the standard `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables for server-side model and API requests. Bun reads them once at process start, so set them before launching:

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 \
HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 \
bunx omp-web@latest
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:HTTP_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:7890"
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:7890"
bunx omp-web@latest
```

Requests to loopback addresses are never proxied, so a local provider (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp) keeps working with a proxy configured. Note that Bun does **not** currently honour `NO_PROXY` for other hosts.

## Features

- **Pick work back up**: browse previous omp conversations by project without digging through terminal history or session paths.
- **Route by role**: assign and switch models per scope of work — the roles omp already uses for subagents, plan mode, and commits.
- **Try different directions safely**: continue from an earlier message or fork a session into a separate route.
- **Work across branches**: switch Git worktrees from the sidebar so new sessions and the Explorer follow the checkout you choose.
- **Chat beside the project**: browse files on the left and preview source, docs, images, audio, and PDFs on the right while the agent works.
- **See session state clearly**: context usage, cost, compaction state, and system prompt details are visible from the top bar.
- **Configure less from the terminal**: manage providers, logins/API keys, model tests, plugins, and skill switches from the web UI.
- **Use the interface in your language**: switch between the supported UI languages from the top bar.

## Screenshots

**Session browsing + file explorer** — projects and past sessions on the left, the project's real file tree underneath, ready to preview or attach to a message.

**Real-time chat with model roles** — the agent's tool calls, cost, context usage, and the active model role are all visible while it works.

**Chat beside the project** — browse and preview a file next to the conversation without losing your place.

![Chat pane next to a rendered Markdown file preview](./docs/screenshots/03-file-preview.png)

**Model roles, configured once, used everywhere** — assign a model per role (`default`, `smol`, `plan`, `commit`, …); both omp-web and the omp CLI read the same `models.yml`.

![Settings panel showing model role assignments](./docs/screenshots/04-settings.png)

**Full omp theme support** — omp-web reads omp's own dark/light palette mappings from `~/.omp/agent/config.yml` and applies them live, so the web view matches the terminal.

## Notes

- **Data directory**: omp-web reads `~/.omp/agent/sessions` by default. Set `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` to point at another omp agent directory (omp kept the variable name).
- **Session files**: files are stored as `~/.omp/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`.
- **Provider config**: the Models panel reads and writes `models.yml` in the omp agent directory. Credentials live in omp's `agent.db`, shared with the CLI. A header value that names an environment variable (bare name, no `$`) is substituted at request time.
- **Custom system prompts**: `SYSTEM.md` and `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` are picked up for browser sessions exactly as `omp` picks them up in a terminal — the project's `.omp/` (or `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.gemini/`) first, then `~/.omp/agent/` — resolved against the session's own working directory.
- **Project trust**: opening a repository in a browser tab must not run its code, so omp-web gates a project's `.omp/extensions`, `.omp/hooks`, `.omp/tools` and `.mcp.json` behind an explicit trust decision. Skills and rules are data and load either way. See [Project trust](./docs/project-trust.md).
- **File access**: file browsing and preview are scoped to the selected project directory and working directories that appear in sessions.
- **Git worktrees**: see [Worktrees in omp-web](./docs/worktrees.md) for when the switcher appears, how new worktrees are created, and what removal does.
- **Forks vs in-session branches**: Fork creates a new `.jsonl` file. "Edit from here" creates another branch inside the same session file.
- **Skills**: the skill installer shells out to `npx skills add --agent claude-code`, which writes the `.claude/skills` layout omp discovers by default.
- **Internationalization**: see [Internationalization](./docs/i18n.md) for using translations and adding languages or UI text.

### Downstream Session Context Menu

Electron wrappers and other downstream integrations can provide a session-row
context menu without patching `SessionSidebar`. Listen for the cancelable
`pi-web:session-row-contextmenu` browser event and call `preventDefault()`
synchronously when the integration will handle it:

```js
window.addEventListener("pi-web:session-row-contextmenu", (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const { id, path, cwd, name, clientX, clientY, refresh } = event.detail;

  void openSessionMenu({ id, path, cwd, name, clientX, clientY }).then((changed) => {
    if (changed) refresh();
  });
});
```

The detail object contains `id`, `path`, `cwd`, optional `name`, pointer
coordinates, and a `refresh()` callback for actions that change the session
list. If no listener cancels the extension event, Pi Web preserves the
browser's native context menu. This hook is browser-side and independent of
Pi agent extensions.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

The local dev server runs at [http://127.0.0.1:30141](http://127.0.0.1:30141).

Common checks:

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun test
```

Avoid running `bun run build` during local development. It writes to `.next/` and can interfere with the dev server; leave builds for release work.

## Desktop (Tauri)

`src-tauri/` is a Tauri v2 shell that runs this same app as a desktop
application: the webview loads the Next.js server, which is started as a Bun
sidecar on a free loopback port. Desktop and CLI share `~/.omp`, so sessions,
credentials and model config are identical across both.

Requires a Rust toolchain in addition to Bun. Useful commands (all defined in
`package.json`):

```bash
bun run desktop:dev          # tauri dev — runs `bun run dev` and opens the webview
bun run desktop:build        # stages the payload (build + production deps) and bundles
bun run desktop:fetch-bun    # downloads pinned Bun binaries into src-tauri/resources/
bun run desktop:sync-version # aligns src-tauri/ versions with package.json
bun scripts/stage-desktop.mjs --skip-build  # re-stage without rebuilding next
bun scripts/build-updater-json.mjs <tag>  # (re)generates latest.json for a release
```

`desktop:build` stages the server payload into `src-tauri/server/` (gitignored):
a production `next` build via `OMP_WEB_DIST_DIR` (the dev `.next/` is never
touched), production-only dependencies, and the Bun runtime(s) for the host
platform. The CI stage step passes `--universal`, which also bundles both
macOS architectures' native runtimes (SWC + pi-natives) for the universal
app. The bundle stays lean: no devDependencies, no webpack cache, no optional
dependencies (onnxruntime/transformers.js for local embeddings — the
platform's native runtimes are kept: `next start` and the SDK's workspace
tree load them eagerly, and a missing SWC would otherwise trigger a
package-manager download that fails in a GUI app), no client-only stats UI —
while keeping the agent's PDF and browser tools (mupdf, puppeteer-core).
Payload ~700MB, dmg ~250MB.

Pushing a `v*` tag triggers `.github/workflows/publish-desktop.yml`: it builds
macOS (universal) and Windows bundles, uploads them to a GitHub release with
Ed25519 signatures, and generates the updater manifest (`latest.json`). The
updater fetches
`https://github.com/jr551/omp-web/releases/latest/download/latest.json`.
To enable that, configure two repository secrets — `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`
(contents of `~/.omp/omp-web/omp-desktop-signing.key`, generated by
`bun run desktop:signer generate`) and `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`.
macOS builds are unsigned: the first launch needs right-click → Open (Gatekeeper),
subsequent auto-updates are written by the app itself.
