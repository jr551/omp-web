# omp-web - Development Notes

## Quick Start

```bash
bun install
bun run dev   # port 30141
```

Typecheck: `bun run typecheck`
Lint: `bun run lint`
Tests: `bun test`
**Never run `bun run build` during dev** — pollutes `.next/` and breaks `bun run dev`.
Exception: `bun run desktop:build` (via `scripts/stage-desktop.mjs`) is safe — it builds
into `src-tauri/server/.next` through `OMP_WEB_DIST_DIR` and never touches the dev `.next/`.

### Everything runs on Bun

`@oh-my-pi/pi-*` is published as **TypeScript sources** and imports `bun:sqlite`,
so Node cannot load it at all (`ERR_UNSUPPORTED_NODE_MODULES_TYPE_STRIPPING`).
The server half of omp-web therefore only runs on Bun; `bin/omp-web.js` finds a
Bun binary and re-executes `next start` through it.

Two consequences worth remembering:

- `next.config.ts` externalizes **every** `@oh-my-pi/*` request as an ESM
  `import`, not `commonjs`. The SDK's `exports` map declares only an `import`
  condition, so a `require()` of it cannot resolve — that is what
  "Cannot find module '@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent'" during *Collecting page data*
  means. `serverExternalPackages` alone is not sufficient: it misses the SDK's
  own transitive entry points.
- `bun test`, not `node --test`. The test files are `node:test`-based and Bun
  runs them; Node cannot import the SDK the tests exercise.

## Architecture

```
Browser                Next.js Server (Bun)        AgentSession (in-process)
  │                        │                               │
  ├─ GET /api/sessions ────▶ reads ~/.omp/agent/sessions/  │
  ├─ GET /api/sessions/[id] reads .jsonl file directly     │
  ├─ GET /api/agent/running ───────▶ running id snapshot   │
  │                        │                               │
  ├─ send message ─────────▶ POST /api/agent/[id]          │
  │                        │   startRpcSession() ─────────▶│ createAgentSession()
  │                        │   session.send(cmd) ─────────▶│ session.prompt()
  │                        │                               │
  ├─ SSE connect ──────────▶ GET /api/agent/[id]/events    │
  │                        │   session.onEvent() ◀─────────│ session.subscribe()
  │◀── data: {...} ─────────│                               │
```

**Session browsing** (read-only): reads `.jsonl` files through SDK helpers and
`lib/session-reader.ts` — no AgentSession created.
**Sending a message**: `startRpcSession()` in `lib/rpc-manager.ts` creates an
AgentSession in-process.

## Key Design Decisions & Traps

### AgentSession lifecycle (`lib/rpc-manager.ts`)
- One `AgentSessionWrapper` per session id, keyed in `globalThis.__ompSessions`
- `globalThis` survives Next.js hot-reload; plain module-level Map does not
- Idle timeout: 10 minutes. Concurrent `startRpcSession()` calls share a single start Promise (`globalThis.__ompStartLocks`)
- Extensions are bound with omp's own `initializeExtensions()` from
  `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent/modes/runtime-init` — the same wiring `omp --mode rpc`
  uses — with a browser-backed `ExtensionUIContext` layered on top. Do not
  reimplement the action set; a mismatch shows up as extensions silently doing
  nothing.

### One runtime, many requests (`lib/omp-runtime.ts`)
omp's CLI builds `Settings` + `AuthStorage` + `ModelRegistry` once per process.
omp-web does the same and caches them on `globalThis`; a second `AuthStorage`
would open a second SQLite handle on `~/.omp/agent/agent.db` and split
`credential_disabled` events. Per-project settings come from
`settings.cloneForCwd(cwd)`, never from a second `Settings.init()`.

Anything that mutates credentials or `models.yml` must call
`invalidateOmpRuntime()` as well as `invalidateModelsCache()`.

### Settings are registry handles (`lib/omp-settings.ts`)
omp 18.2 removed the path-keyed `settings.get("a.b")` / `settings.set()` /
`getGroup()` API and `config/settings-schema`; every setting is now a typed
`Setting` handle from `config/registry`. omp-web still addresses settings by
dotted path (the browser sends paths, `/api/settings` is generated from the
schema), so `lib/omp-settings.ts` is the only place that maps a path to a
handle (`getSetting` / `setSetting` / `isSettingConfigured` plus the schema
helpers). Do not call registry `lookup()` elsewhere. Tests that need settings
use `Settings.isolated({ "goal.enabled": true, ... })`, not a `{ get }` stub.

Likewise `AuthStorage` became namespaced: `credentials.{list,set,remove}`,
`keys.source()` (replaces `getCredentialOrigin` / `hasAuth`) and
`oauth.login()`. Theme, thinking-level and goal-tool types moved to
`@oh-my-pi/pi-tui` (`theme/theme`, `thinking`, `tools/goal`).

### Model roles are the model selector
omp assigns a model per scope of work (`default`, `smol`, `slow`, `vision`,
`plan`, `designer`, `commit`, `tiny`, `task`, `advisor`), stored in the
`modelRoles` record in `config.yml`. `lib/model-roles.ts` reads and writes that
record; `GET /api/models` ships the resolved table so `ChatInput` can list roles
above the flat model list, and `set_role_model` switches the session **and
records the role** so the transcript matches what `/model` writes in the TUI.

An explicit model pick in the browser is persisted as `modelRoles.default`
(`lib/startup-preferences.ts`), which is the same slot the TUI writes.

### Fork must destroy the wrapper immediately
`AgentSession.fork()` **mutates the wrapper's inner state in-place** — after fork, `inner.sessionId` is the *new* session's id. If the wrapper stays alive in the registry under the old id, the next request gets the already-forked state and subsequent forks produce a corrupt `parentSession` chain.

**Fix**: `send("fork")` captures `newSessionId`, then calls `this.destroy()` before returning. The next request for the original session reloads a clean AgentSession from the original file.

### Two kinds of branching — don't confuse them
- **Fork** (Fork button on user message): creates a new independent `.jsonl` file. Shown as a child in the sidebar tree via `parentSession` header field.
- **In-session branch** (Continue button / BranchNavigator): calls `navigate_tree` within the same file. Multiple entries share the same `parentId`. Switching between them calls `/api/sessions/[id]/context?leafId=`.

### Session files can be fully rewritten
`parentSession` in the header is **display metadata only** — has zero effect on chat content. Safe to `writeFileSync` the entire file (omp does this itself during migrations). Used when cascade-reparenting children on delete.

### `SessionManager.open()` is async
Every omp `SessionManager.open()` / `forkFrom()` / `continueRecent()` returns a
Promise, and `setSessionName()` / `newSession()` / `flush()` do too. Forgetting
an `await` yields `Property 'getEntries' does not exist on type 'Promise<…>'`.

### Transcript ordering follows omp, not the LLM context
`buildSessionContext()` in `lib/session-reader.ts` mirrors omp's live-chat
transcript (`{ transcript: true, collapseCompactedHistory: true }`): history
replaced by the latest compaction is elided, and the summary renders **at the
chronological compaction point** — after the kept messages, before the
post-compaction turns. It is not the LLM context, where the summary comes first.
`entryIds` is a parallel array to `messages` and is walked locally because omp's
`buildSessionContext` does not return entry ids.

### ToolCall field normalization
omp stores toolCall blocks as `{type:"toolCall", id, name, arguments}` but `ToolCallContent` uses `{toolCallId, toolName, input}`. `normalizeToolCalls()` in `lib/normalize.ts` handles this — called in both `session-reader.ts` (file load) and `ChatWindow.handleAgentEvent()` (streaming).

### New session tool preset
Tool names are passed at session creation (`POST /api/agent/new` → `toolNames[]`). For existing sessions, the active preset is inferred on mount via `get_tools` → `getPresetFromTools()`. When tools are fully disabled (`toolNames = []`), `rpc-manager.ts` passes `toolNames: []` with `restrictToolNames: true` and forces `agent.state.systemPrompt = []` after startup and reloads.

### `enabledModels` scoping
The `enabledModels` setting uses omp's `--models` syntax: globs against
`provider/modelId` or a bare `modelId`, fuzzy matching for non-glob patterns, and
an optional `:thinkingLevel` suffix. Never compare those patterns as literal
strings — `lib/model-scope.ts` delegates to the SDK's `resolveModelScope()` so
omp-web and the TUI agree on the visible model list, and falls back to all
available models when patterns resolve to nothing. Diagnostics are produced by
re-resolving each pattern alone, because omp's resolver drops unmatched patterns
silently.

### Project trust is omp-web's own
omp has no trust store — it runs a repository's extensions because you ran it
there. A browser tab is not that decision, so `lib/project-trust.ts` keeps a
store in `~/.omp/agent/omp-web-trusted-projects.json` and, for an untrusted
project, filters project-local entries out of omp's discovered extension and
custom-tool paths and disables MCP. Skills and rules are data and always load.
See `docs/project-trust.md`.

### Plan mode is toggled with the ACP semantics
omp's `/plan` is a TUI-only builtin (`handleTui`), so `execute_slash_command`
cannot run it and it used to reach the model as text. The browser handles
`/plan` itself and sends `set_plan_mode`, which does what omp's ACP mode switch
does (`lib/plan-mode-web.ts`): set/clear `PlanModeState` and the plan-proposal
handler, append a `mode_change` journal entry (the same record the TUI writes
and restores from), and emit a `mode_change` SSE event. It is refused while the
agent runs and while goal mode is active. Approval still goes through the
existing `plan_review` dialog.

### `SYSTEM.md` / `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` are resolved per session cwd
`omp` resolves both files before it creates a session and passes them as
`customSystemPrompt` / `appendSystemPrompt`. `startRpcSession()` builds its own
options, so `lib/session-system-prompt.ts` does the same for the browser: omp's
`findConfigFile` (never a hand-rolled lookup) project-first then user-level,
`resolvePromptInput` to read it, and omp's `applyResolvedSystemPromptInputs` to
set the fields — so the text goes through the same templates the CLI renders it
with. Every lookup is bound to the session's cwd, because the CLI's default
(`getProjectDir()`) is the server's own directory here, not the project's.
Project-local prompt files load for untrusted projects too: they are data, like
skills and rules (`docs/project-trust.md`).

### SSE reconnect on page refresh mid-stream
On `ChatWindow` mount, `GET /api/agent/[id]` is called. If `state.isStreaming === true`, SSE is reconnected automatically. `thinkingLevel` and `isCompacting` are also synced from this response.

### Compaction SSE events
Newer omp emits `compaction_start` / `compaction_end`; older versions emitted `auto_compaction_start` / `auto_compaction_end`. `handleAgentEvent` accepts both sets to keep `isCompacting` in sync. Manual compact is a blocking POST — the button stays disabled until the response returns.

### Running state polling + reconciliation
- The sidebar polls `/api/agent/running` every 2.5 seconds while the tab is visible and pauses polling in background tabs. The session-list response remains the initial fallback.
- `useAgentSession` treats per-session SSE as primary for chat events and opens it before each prompt. `prompt_done` completes the current UI stage and notification immediately, but the idle SSE stays open for a 30-second grace window and is reused by the next prompt. `agent_start` cancels that close timer; `agent_settled` finishes extension-injected runs that have no wrapper-level `prompt_done` and starts a fresh grace window. Do not close on the first `agent_end`: retries, compaction, and extension-queued messages can continue the same logical prompt.
- While a run is active, `useAgentSession` periodically calls `GET /api/agent/[id]` and also reconciles on `visibilitychange`/`online`. This fixes missed terminal events from background tabs or half-open connections.
- Prompt runs use a monotonic run id; late SSE or slow reconciliation responses from an old run must be ignored so they cannot resurrect stale streaming bubbles.

### Worktrees and project grouping
- `lib/worktree.ts` resolves linked worktree top-levels back to the main repo `projectRoot`; `listAllSessions()` attaches that to each `SessionInfo` so all worktrees for one repo are grouped together in the sidebar.
- Worktree operations are served by `/api/worktrees` and guarded by the same allowed-root rules as `/api/files`.
- New worktrees are created under `<repoRoot>-worktrees/<sanitized-branch>`. Existing branches are reused; otherwise `git worktree add -b` creates the branch.
- Removing a dirty worktree returns `409` with `{ dirty: true }` so the UI can ask before retrying with `force`.
- Sessions whose cwd points at a removed worktree are inferred back into the main project instead of becoming a phantom project row.

### File access allow-list
- `/api/files` is intentionally not a general filesystem browser. Allowed roots come from session cwds, their resolved project roots, `~/omp-cwd-*`, and roots explicitly added with `allowFileRoot()`.
- `/api/cwd/validate`, `/api/default-cwd`, and `/api/worktrees` call `allowFileRoot()` when they make a new location browsable.

### Plugins and skills
- `/api/plugins` drives omp's `PluginManager` (`~/.omp/plugins`): install, uninstall, enable/disable, plus `doctor()` output as diagnostics. omp has no in-place update, so "update" reinstalls the spec with `force`.
- `/api/skills` uses omp's own `loadSkills()`, so `.omp/skills`, `~/.omp/agent/skills`, `.claude/skills`, plugin skills and `.agents/skills` are listed exactly as a session sees them.
- Skill toggling edits only the `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter key on the target `SKILL.md`; keep that surgical so user formatting survives.
- `/api/skills/install` shells through `npx skills add ... --agent claude-code`. The `skills` CLI has no `omp` agent, and its `pi` agent writes `~/.pi/agent/skills`, which omp does **not** read; the Claude layout is discovered by default.

### Auth and model config
- Credentials live in omp's SQLite `agent.db` via `AuthStorage`, not in `auth.json`. Writes go through `authStorage.set()` / `remove()` / `logout()` so the CLI and omp-web share one store and one lock.
- Provider listing is capability-driven: `lib/provider-listing-runtime.ts` folds the catalog (`@oh-my-pi/pi-catalog`), the OAuth registry (`@oh-my-pi/pi-ai/oauth`) and stored credential types into the flat shape `lib/provider-listing.ts` expects, so a dual-auth provider appears exactly once. An OAuth login whose `storeCredentialsAs` differs from its id is keyed by the id the catalog uses.
- OAuth flows are streamed by `GET /api/auth/login/[provider]` through `authStorage.login()`; `onAuth`/`onPrompt`/`onManualCodeInput` become browser input requests with short-lived tokens stored in `globalThis.__ompLoginCallbacks`.
- API-key status endpoints must never return the raw key.
- `models.yml` is YAML: `/api/models-config` parses whichever of `models.yml` / `models.yaml` / `models.json` exists and always writes back `models.yml`.
- A header value in `models.yml` that names an environment variable is written as the **bare name** (`X-Token: MY_VAR`), not `$MY_VAR`.

### Password access is verified in the proxy, stored hashed, and shared with `bin/`
`bin/web-auth-store.js` is the single source of truth for the password lock, and
it is CommonJS in `bin/` on purpose: the launcher needs it before Bun is even
resolved, and `bin/` is the only directory (besides `.next`) in the published
npm `files` list, so `lib/` cannot hold it. `bin/web-auth-store.d.ts` is what the
TypeScript half type-checks against — keep the two in sync.

- Sign-in is a **form**, not the browser's Basic dialog. `proxy.ts` redirects an
  unauthenticated navigation to `/login` (page `app/login/`) and returns `401`
  (no `WWW-Authenticate`) with `{ loginPath }` for API calls. `/login` posts to
  `POST /api/web-access/login`, which verifies the password and sets an httpOnly
  `omp_web_session` cookie; `POST /api/web-access/logout` clears it. The cookie is
  an HMAC over an expiry, keyed by a value **derived from the active credential**
  (`sessionKeyFromPolicy` in `lib/web-auth.ts`), so it survives restarts but a
  password change invalidates every existing session. An `Authorization: Basic`
  header is still accepted for non-browser API clients. `/login`,
  `/api/web-access/login` and `/logout` join `/recover` in the proxy's
  unauthenticated allow-list (host + cross-site checks still apply).

- The password is stored **only** as a scrypt digest in
  `<agentDir>/omp-web-auth.json` (`0600`, atomic replace). Nothing can read it
  back, which is why `/recover` and `--reset-password` exist.
- `proxy.ts` runs on Next.js 16's Node.js runtime (proxy always does), so
  `node:fs` and `node:crypto` are available there. Do **not** import the omp SDK
  into it — `next.config.ts` only externalizes `@oh-my-pi/*` for the server
  build, and the SDK cannot be bundled. That is why the store re-derives the
  agent directory instead of calling `getAgentDir()`.
- `resolveWebAuthPolicy()` distinguishes a missing credential file (unlocked)
  from an unreadable one (`unavailable` -> 503). Never collapse those: the
  second one failing open would silently unlock the server.
- Successful verifications are cached for five minutes keyed by the digest that
  accepted them, because scrypt runs on every request otherwise. The key
  includes the digest, so a password change invalidates the cache across
  bundles.
- `/recover` and `POST /api/web-access/recovery` are the only unauthenticated
  paths. They still go through the host allow-list and cross-site checks, and
  the recovery code is printed on the server's stdout, never returned in the
  response.

### Tab switching performance
Switching file tabs used to swap the `filePath` of a single `FileViewer`, which
reset it to "Loading…", re-fetched the file, re-opened its watcher and re-ran
Prism over the whole file; the AppShell render it came from also re-rendered the
whole chat, re-running the markdown pipeline for every final answer. Keep these
in place:
- Every open tab is its own `FileViewer`, keyed by tab id, inside
  `<Activity mode="visible|hidden">` (React 19.2). Hidden tabs keep their state
  and DOM, but their effects are unmounted — which closes their file watchers,
  so N open tabs never hold N SSE connections against the browser's
  per-origin limit.
- Because Activity re-runs effects when a tab is shown again, `FileViewer`
  effects must tell "same path, re-shown" from "new path": the load effect
  only revalidates quietly (`loadedPathRef`), and one-shot defaults (preview
  for markdown/HTML, auto-diff) remember what they were applied for. Hiding a
  scroll container with `display: none` loses its offset, so
  `usePreservedScroll` puts it back.
- Highlighted source, markdown preview and diff output are `useMemo`'d on the
  file content; `setData` / `setGitDiff` / the selected line range keep the old
  object when nothing changed so those memos hold.
- `ChatWindow`, `SessionSidebar`, `FileViewer` and `MarkdownBody` are
  `memo()`'d. That only works while AppShell passes stable callbacks — wrap new
  handler props in `useCallback`, never an inline arrow.
- `ChatWindow` builds the grouped transcript in one `useMemo` (streaming chunks
  live in `streamState` and do not invalidate it), and the process/answer
  messages split out of a final assistant message are cached per message
  object (`getFinalAssistantParts`). A fresh object per render defeats
  `MessageView`'s memo and re-parses every answer's markdown.

The chat is not a tab and is never hidden: selecting another session still
remounts `ChatWindow` (`key={sessionKey}`), because `useAgentSession` loads and
wires SSE in mount-only effects.

### Popovers and dialogs stay inside the viewport
- Anchored popups use `lib/popup-placement.ts`: `computePopupPlacement()` picks
  above/below and caps the height; `computeAnchoredPanelRect()` also clamps the
  width/left to the visible viewport (plus optional bounds) for fixed-position
  panels such as the top-bar dropdowns. `observeViewportLayout()` in
  `hooks/usePopupPlacement.ts` is the one subscription (ResizeObserver, window
  resize/scroll, visualViewport) to re-measure them.
- The top-bar session/cost panel lays out its grid from the measured panel width
  (`lib/session-info-layout.ts`); never give it fixed column minimums again —
  with both side panels open the centre column can be narrower than 770px.
- Modals add `viewport-dialog-backdrop` (fixed backdrop) and `viewport-dialog`
  (the dialog box) from `app/globals.css`. Those rules only clamp with
  `!important`, so each dialog keeps its inline preferred size. Use `dvh` or
  `--app-viewport-height`, never `100vh`, when sizing a modal; embedded settings
  panes must not get the classes.

### Screen-edge hover reveal
- `hooks/useEdgeReveal.ts` opens the left sidebar / right file panel when a
  mouse rests in a 6px strip at the screen edge for 300ms. Only for
  `(hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` and plain `mouse` pointer events, never
  on the mobile layout, not while a button is held, a modal
  (`[aria-modal="true"]`, Settings, project trust) is open, or the pointer is
  over a control or scrollbar.
- A hover-opened panel closes 400ms after the pointer leaves it (the resize
  handle counts as inside). Clicking/typing inside it, grabbing its resize
  handle, or pressing its toggle button pins it instead of closing it.
- The timing rules are the pure `stepEdgeReveal()` state machine (unit-tested);
  the hook only feeds it pointer samples and timer ticks and keeps everything
  in refs, so pointer moves never re-render AppShell.
- Preference: `localStorage["omp-edge-reveal"]` (`"false"` disables it, default
  on), toggled from Settings -> Web UI.

### Completion sound
- `hooks/useAudio.ts` stores the toggle in `localStorage` as `omp-sound-enabled` and reuses one `AudioContext`.
- Browser autoplay policy means sound must be unlocked from a user gesture; `ChatInput` calls the unlock hook from interactive controls, and `ChatWindow` plays the tone from `onAgentEnd`.

### Exported session HTML
- `/api/sessions/[id]/export` delegates to omp's export helper, then patches recursive tree helpers in the generated HTML to iterative versions so very deep linear sessions do not overflow the browser call stack.

### HTTP proxying
Bun's `fetch` reads `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` **once at process
start**. Bun ≤1.3 never proxied loopback; Bun 1.4 does, which breaks local
providers (ollama, lm-studio, llama.cpp) behind a proxy. The launchers
(`withLoopbackNoProxy()` in `bin/runtime.js`, `loopback_no_proxy()` in
`src-tauri/src/main.rs`) therefore append `localhost,127.0.0.1,::1` to
`NO_PROXY` before spawning Bun. `lib/http-dispatcher.ts` is therefore a no-op under Bun; its undici
`EnvHttpProxyAgent` path only exists for a dev server run on Node, because Bun
resolves `undici` to its own shim where `setGlobalDispatcher` does not affect
`fetch` and `install` does not exist.

### Routines (native scheduler)

omp-web can run a prompt in a project unattended, on a schedule or a condition.

- **Store** (`lib/routine-store.ts`): routines persist as JSON at
  `<agentDir>/omp-web-routines.json` (`0600`, atomic replace via
  `writePrivateFileAtomicSync`), with an in-memory copy cached on `globalThis`
  like project-trust/rpc-manager. A `Routine` is
  `{ id, name, cwd, trigger, prompt, provider?, modelId?, maxExecutionMs,
  enabled, createdAt, updatedAt, lastRun?, history? }` (history capped at 20).
  Client-safe types + bounds live in `lib/routine-types.ts` so the browser can
  import them without pulling in `fs`/the SDK. `validateRoutineFields()` is pure
  (no fs) and unit-tested; the API layer adds the existing-dir + allowed-roots
  check. A legacy top-level `schedule` string is migrated to
  `trigger: { type: "cron" }` on load.
- **Trigger** is a tagged union:
  `{ type: "cron", schedule }` (standard 5-field cron, `lib/cron.ts`) or
  `{ type: "guard", intervalMs, command, guardTimeoutMs, expectOutputMatches? }`
  — every `intervalMs`, run `command` via `bash -lc` (`lib/guard-command.ts`,
  reusable/injectable) with its own timeout; the prompt runs only when it exits
  0 (and matches the optional stdout regex), otherwise a `skipped` history entry
  is recorded (consecutive identical skips collapse into one) and no agent runs.
- **Cron** (`lib/cron.ts`): self-contained `parseCron` / `cronMatches` /
  `describeCron`. `*`, lists, ranges, `*/n`, `a-b/n`, `?`≈`*`; day-of-week 0/7
  are both Sunday; standard OR semantics when both DOM and DOW are restricted.
- **Scheduler** (`lib/routine-scheduler.ts`): a `globalThis` singleton started
  once from `instrumentation.ts` — note it runs under **Bun too**, so it lives
  *before* the Bun guard in `register()` (unlike the Node-only http-dispatcher).
  A ~30s `setInterval` tick fires due routines; cron firings dedupe on
  `lastTriggeredMinute`, guards on `lastGuardCheck`. At most one run per routine
  and a global cap of 3 concurrent. Each run gets a fresh session via
  `startRpcSession` (default tool preset, routine model or project default),
  sends the prompt, and enforces `maxExecutionMs` with an `AbortController`
  (abort → `timeout`). The summary (≤280 chars) comes from the last assistant
  text (else "No output"). The tick/dedupe/guard/summary logic is injectable
  (fake clock + fake runner/guard) and unit-tested — **no real agents in tests**.
- **Runner factoring** (`lib/routine-runner.ts`): `runPromptInSession()` /
  `runPromptInFreshSession()` are the reusable "deliver a prompt into a run"
  path, kept callable so future features (e.g. smartwake) can reuse them.
- **API** (`app/api/routines/`): `route.ts` GET/POST, `[id]/route.ts`
  GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, `[id]/run/route.ts` POST (run now, returns 202 without
  blocking). All gated by `isApiRequestAllowed`; writes require JSON; the cwd is
  authorized against allowed roots exactly like `/api/agent/new`, and
  `allowFileRoot()` keeps a new cwd browsable.
- **UI**: `components/RoutinesConfig.tsx` (a viewport-dialog modal opened from
  the sidebar footer button and per-project Routines subsection) creates/edits
  routines, with a Cron|Condition toggle, live `describeCron` preview, model
  picker (`SearchableSelect` over `/api/models`), max-exec presets, and run
  history. `components/SessionSidebar.tsx` renders a collapsible per-project
  "Routines" subsection of clock-icon rows (name + last-run summary + run/pause
  state, hover actions Run/Enable/Delete/Edit); collapse state persists under
  `omp-web:collapsed-routine-sections`. Keep the sidebar memo rules — the new
  `onOpenRoutines` prop is a stable `useCallback` and rows are plain
  subcomponents with stable handlers.
- **Scratch projects** (`lib/scratch-project.ts`): `~/omp-cwd-YYYYMMDD` and
  temp-dir roots render as "Non Project Related" (i18n `sidebar.nonProjectRelated`),
  pinned to the top of the sidebar with a muted `--warning` folder icon.
- i18n keys live under `routines.*` in `lib/i18n/messages/{en,zh-CN}.ts`.

## omp Session File Format

Location: `~/.omp/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`

```jsonl
{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"<uuid>","timestamp":"...","cwd":"/path","parentSession":"/abs/path/to/parent.jsonl"}
{"type":"model_change","id":"<8hex>","parentId":null,"model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-5","role":"default","timestamp":"..."}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"user","content":"..."}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[...],...}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"toolResult","toolCallId":"...","content":[...]}}
{"type":"compaction","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","summary":"...","firstKeptEntryId":"<8hex>","tokensBefore":N}
{"type":"session_info","id":"...","parentId":"...","name":"user-defined name"}
```

`model_change` carries a `provider/modelId` string plus the **role** it came
from; `SessionContext.models` is a role → selector record, and `models.default`
is what the UI shows as the session's model.

## CSS Variables (`app/globals.css`)

Both themes come from omp's own theme files — `titanium` (omp's default dark
theme) and `light` — so the browser and the TUI read as one product.

```
--bg --bg-panel --bg-hover --bg-selected --border
--text --text-muted --text-dim
--accent --accent-hover --user-bg --assistant-bg --tool-bg --bg-subtle
--success --danger --warning
--font-mono
```

`--font-mono` is a system stack on purpose: a local-first tool must not fetch a
font from a CDN at build or at runtime.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **omp-web** (2786 symbols, 7305 relationships, 233 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
